 # <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description: 
The motivation behind this webpage is simple: to make a long, arduous process of a programming bootcamp, maybe a little easier! Along the way I was introduced to important languages such as: HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Git, and the concepts behind them. We solved a couple of problems along the way, by building a fondational knowledge of the important topics.

## Usage

The website is comprised of four sections, each including notes about a particular topic covered during this prework course. The topics should come up at random, and we can use our tools to help us decide what to run first! These can be accessed with the DevTools console, and choose one for us to study!
