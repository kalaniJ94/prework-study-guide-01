        <ol>
          <li>Elements are types of content on a webpage, the two most important of which are head and body elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, known as metadata, which helps the browser render correctly..</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Common tags include: Title, Style, base, link, meta, script, charset, and viewport.</li>
            </li>
          </ul>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user, which they can see and interact with.</li>
     <ul>
            <li>Common tags include H1-6, p, ul ol and li, img, br and a.</li>
     </ul>
     <li>Attributes define additional information for an element.</li>
     <li>Elements inside of another elements are called Child Elements. The original is now called a Parent element.
      <li>Semantic Elements are elements where the name of the element describes the content and the role it plays. An example would be a table element.</li>
      <li>Element vs tag: Tags are what is inside of angle brackets, and element is everything in between opening and closing brackets. </li>
      <li>Headings are at the top, contain h1-h6 info.</li>
      <li>Footer tags are at the bottom, contain info such as copyright, author, ect.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ol>
          <li> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li> Inline, which is to style directly witht he HTML file.</li>
                  <li> Internal CSS Sheets, which is to insert CSS directly into the head section of an HTML file.</li>
                  <li> External CSS files, which is the practice of keeping CSS in a seperate file, then linking to that file in the Doc.</li>
                </ul>
          
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
           <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>An important concept for coding is Seperation of concerns, which is the practice of keeping code in different files based on use. </li>
          <li> DRY Method - Do Not Repeat Yourself. Keep code simple!</li>
          <li> Declerations are used in CSS to provide values. They consist of values and propertys (of that value).</li>

          <li> Creating a branch:
            <ul> 
                <li> navigate to correct directory using cd commands</li>
                <li> check your current git branch with git status command</li>
                <li> Use git checkout main to commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
                <li> git checkout -b "descriptive name" to create a new branch in your github repo.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Closing a branch: 
            <ul> 
                <li> git add -A : stages changes to the working directory.</li>
                <li> git commit -m ["descriptive message"]: commits your staged content as a new commit snapshot.</li>
                <li> git pull origin main: Pulls the base branch into the feature branch.</li>
                <li> git push origin "name of branch": pushes up all changes into git. </li>
